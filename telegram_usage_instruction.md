```bash
# Telegram Configuration
TELEGRAM_API_ID=            # API ID from my.telegram.org/apps
TELEGRAM_API_HASH=          # API Hash from my.telegram.org/apps
TELEGRAM_PHONE_NUMBER=      # Your phone number in international format
TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_GROUPS=    # (Optional) Comma-separated list of group usernames (e.g., CryptoTalk,AIDiscussion)
TELEGRAM_SESSION=           # Will be auto-generated after first login
```

### 3. Configure Allowed Groups (Optional)

To restrict the bot to specific groups:
1. Add your bot to the desired Telegram groups
2. Set the `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_GROUPS` variable with the group usernames:
   ```bash
   TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_GROUPS=CryptoTalk,AIDiscussion,BlockchainHub
   ```
3. The bot will only respond in these specified groups
4. Group usernames are case-sensitive and should match exactly as shown in the invite link (e.g., if the invite link is t.me/MyGroup, use "MyGroup")
5. Leave empty to allow the bot to respond in all groups

### 4. Start Eliza with CryptoAI Sage

Run the following command to start Eliza with the CryptoAI Sage character:

```bash
pnpm start --characters=characters/cryptoai_sage.character.json
```

### 5. First-Time Login

### 6. Subsequent Runs

After the initial setup, you can simply use the same start command:

```bash
pnpm start --characters=characters/cryptoai_sage.character.json
```

## Usage Tips

- The bot will only respond in groups listed in `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_GROUPS`

- You can add or remove groups by updating the `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_GROUPS` list
- If no groups are specified, the bot will not respond to any messages
- You can interact with the bot in both private chats and groups just make sure to mention them in .env

1. Ensure all environment variables are correctly set
2. Check that your API credentials are valid
3. Make sure your phone number is in the correct international format
4. If the session expires, delete the session string from `.env` and log in again
